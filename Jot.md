Any source code matching the regular expression `(0|1)*` is a valid Jot program, including the null program.

It can be represented in Haskell as the type `[bool]`, or as `[bool]` in rust.

It can also be represented [[../λs as numbers|as a binary number of arbitrary size]], which is the encoding utilized by [[λSystem|λSystem]].
