This programming language is [documented here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112014512/http://www.nyu.edu/projects/barker/Iota/) (archive.org warning).

Any source code matching the regular expression `(0|1)*` is a valid Jot program, including the null program.

It can be represented in Haskell as the type `[bool]`, or as `[bool]` in rust.

It can also be represented [[../位System/位s as numbers |as a binary number of arbitrary size]], which is the encoding utilized by [[../位System/README|位System]].
